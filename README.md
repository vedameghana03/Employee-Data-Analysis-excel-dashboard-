# Employee-Data-Analysis-excel-dashboard-
This project is part of my data science internship, where I explored key patterns in employee resignation using Excel dashboards.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Excel workbook includes visual analysis on:

- **Department & Job Title Analysis** – Monthly salary, satisfaction, and resignation trends across roles.
- **Training Effort vs Resignation** – Impact of training intensity on employee attrition.
- **Remote Work Insight** – How different remote work patterns affect satisfaction and resignation.
- **Overtime vs Satisfaction** – Relationship between extra hours and employee happiness.
- **Team Size vs Satisfaction** – Employee sentiment in small, medium, and large teams.
- **Promotions vs Performance** – Promotion trends based on performance scores.
- **Top 5 Departments by Resignation** – Departments with the highest resignation counts.
- **Overall Satisfaction Distribution** – Proportion of high, medium, and low satisfaction employees.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Employees who **rarely work remotely** have the **highest resignation rate**.
- **High training effort** is not reducing resignations – it may indicate mismatch or unmet expectations.
- **Medium-sized teams** report the **lowest satisfaction**.
- Promotions are **not aligned with high performance**.
- Departments like **Marketing, Finance, and Operations** have the **highest resignation counts**.
